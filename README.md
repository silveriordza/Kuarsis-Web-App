//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Git Tag: tagkuarxisFeSurveySystemDEV-v1.0.8.2
Version date: 01/02/25
Modificator name: Silverio Rodriguez Alcorta
ENHANCEMENTS:
1.- Issue fixed: when surveys does not have any Integer (Numeric) value and only contain strings, it had an error related to "Cannot delete child", because the DataGrid in the SurveyOutputScreen specifically in the KuarxisDataGrid.js component was adding AggregateColumnDirectives for all columns that were Integer, but if there are no Integers it resulted in a the AggregateDirective parent of AggregateDirective in which turn it didn't have any AggregateColumnsDirective because the no outputlayout.dataType="Integer". To fix this, we added a condition to check if there is any Integers in survey output layout, if there are non, then the whole AggregatesDirective section is not added, otherwise it is added and it will add corresponding child directives for all integer columns.
2.- Flexibility added to the SurveyOutput Dashboard to allow dinaymic configuration of the pieCharts for the Surveys.

Git Tag: tagkuarxisFeSurveySystemDEV-v1.0.8.1 -> tagkuarxisFeSurveySystemQA-v1.0.8.1
Version date: 6/9/24
Modificator name: Silverio Rodriguez Alcorta
ENHANCEMENTS:
1.- Added React memo to the DataGrid component in SurveyOuputsScreen to memoize the DataGrid component, this in order to fix performance issue when user typing a new search keyword or changing the page setting was causing slow performance, user was not even able to see the text he typed or the page number he typed because the DataGrid was re-rendering the whole grid on every letter the user typed causing long delay between the user typing the letter, grid rendering and then React showing the letter the user typed took about 5 to 6 seconds, which was a bad user experience. This was fixed by creating a new component called KuarxisDataGrid and memoizing it using the memo feature of React, then on the memo comparison there is an isReRender flag which will be always false meaning do not render and is also checking if the page setting changed, this will cause the KuarxisDataGrid component not to render when the user is changing the search keyword or if the user has not changed the page setting, given that the other props like SurveyOutputsInfo and the gridDataSourceArray will change only when the timer of the keyword Search or the timer of the page setting has triggered, the KuarxisDataGrid component will render only when those props change, it will not render of the keyword Search or the page Setting has not triggered the timer to commit the changes yet. This fixed the performance issue.

NOTES:
No changes to back end were needed in this version, only front end changes.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Git Tag: tagkuarxisFeSurveySystemDEV-v1.0.6.1
Version date: 4/01/24
Modificator name: Silverio Rodriguez Alcorta
ENHANCEMENTS:
1.- Front end redesign to support the backend redesign of processing outputs and answers.
2.- Added functionality to download the survey answer output as a text file showing the columns vertically and the values beside.
3.- Removed the Upload Surveys Answers option from the menu, since it is no longer needed.

Git Tag: tagkuarxisFeSurveySystemDEV-v1.0.0.5
Version date: 1/13/24
Modificator name: Silverio Rodriguez Alcorta
ENHANCEMENTS:
1.- Fixed defect: negative number showing up in the upload status in UploadSurveyAnswers when picking option NEW responses only. This fix was made in the Front End surveyActions.js in the slice calculations.
2.- Modularized the Survey Monkey calls into a MonkeyManager class, for better code reusability. Removed logic form the path surveys/surveymonkey/:id handler and transfered it to the MonkeyManager, the handler now calls MonkeyManager functions to execute logic and it only servers as a controller of the logic.
3.- Added a MonkeyWebhook for Completed Survey event with its corresponding handler function on the path surveys/surveymonkey/webhookcompletedeventTalentos2020. This path will be triggered by Survey Monkey whenever a new survey response is completed by a user, and it will also trigger the processing of the survey responses in the KSS system which will then store the responses into the corresponding output collection.
4.- Redesigned the update responses handler to integrate it with the MonkeyWebhook (mentioned above) so that when the webhook is triggered, the update responses function will process the survey accordingly.

Git Tag: tagkuarxisFeSurveySystemDEV-v1.0.0.4
Version date: 12/24/23
Modificator name: Silverio Rodriguez Alcorta
ENHANCEMENTS:
1.- Optimized the survey action to process Upload Answers by adding an option to only upload new answers, or reprocess the whole file again. This improved the upload time from 1.5 min to only 5 seconds for an average of 6 new answers on the files, instead of reprocessing all surveys which took the 1.5 min waiting time.
2.- Started integration with Survey Monkey to check which are the new answers added comparing versus the existent answers in the database.
3.- Started integratiion of the Create Survey Configs with Survey Monkey API to map the Survey System config to the survey monkey configs and later use it to get answers from Survey Monkey API automatically without uploading a file manually.

Git Tag: tagkuarxisFeSurveySystemQA-v1.0.0.3
Version date: 12/19/23
Modificator name: Silverio Rodriguez Alcorta
ENHANCEMENTS:
1.- Fixed issue when username is created with all UPPERCASE, but then users logs in with user in lowercase, the system was not finding that user and declined access. Fixed issue by making the user name search case-insensitive using RegEx with the i option when looking for username in mongoose User.FindOne.
2.- Fixed issue with the User Edit screen sometimes it tries to load the data when the User info is still undefined, added a additiona condition to the IF statement in the useEffect to check if User object is undefined, in which case it will dispatch the getUserDetails action, all this in the UserEditScreen.
3.- Returning a more friendly message when user and password does not match, saying "Email o password inv√°lidos."

Version date: 12/18/23
Modificator name: Silverio Rodriguez Alcorta
ENHANCEMENTS:
1.- Fixed intermitemn disconnection issue. Root cause: the JWT_SECRET to validate token, sometimes was not populated in the process.env.JWT_SECRET variable, there seems to be a problem with it. I changed the logic to get the secret value directly from aws usig the SSM AWS module. Created new library awsMiscellaneous.js to include a function to return the secret value from AWS given the variable name.

Git Tag: arpixwfdev-v1.0.0.4
Version date: 6/19/23
Modificator name: Silverio Rodriguez Alcorta

ENHANCEMENTS:
1.- Added the isShippable flag to the ProductEditScreen and to the ProductListAdminScreen, to show when the product is shippable or not, and also to create product with this flag or update the product with this flag.
2.- Added a LogThisLegacy function into the Logger.js file in the utils folder. This function will log a user provided message into the console.log only when the LOG_LEVEL constant is equal or greater to 1, this value can be set in the environmentConstants.js file.
3.- Added address information (address, internal number, city, state, postal code, country) into the User Profile, User Registration, User Details Admin.
4.- Added product types to the products to mark when they are shippable, downloadable, bookable, and image protected, including columns in the Product List Admin.
5.- Added logic into the OrderScreen that identifies when any of the products in the order, are shippable, in which case it shows up the Mark as Delivered button (if the user is admin), shows Download button only for downloadable products, the "To be shipped"/"Shipped" message, and the "To be booked" "booked" message for products that are shippable and bookable correspondingly. If the order has not been paid, the Download button will not show up, nor the shipped or booked messages.
6.- Issue resolved: PayPalButtons disappearing from the OrderScreen. Redesigned OrderScreen useEffect to separate static values from dynamic values and added a semaphore flag to avoid charging PayPalButton script more than once while the script is still being loaded.
7.- Improved the OrderScreen useEffect logic, separating static from dynamic objects, loading the static ones only once and the dynamic ones everytime one or more objects change.
8.- Added logic into the RegisterScreen to display a list of states as a drop down to validate the State when user is providing the address information. Added configsReducer, configsActions, configsConstants, and updated the RegisterScreen to get the AddressStates information from the backend.

Git Tag: arpixwfdev-v1.0.0.2
Version date: 5/27/23
Modificator name: Silverio Rodriguez Alcorta

ENHANCEMENTS:
1.- Renamed business specific file names like PixanHomeScreen to a more generic name ProductsStoreScreen, same for all other specific file names, this in order to reuse it for different businesses that have similar website structure, that way we don't have to keep changing the javascript filenames just because the business has a different name.
2.- Rebranded Kuarxis to Kuarxis on all the javascript files, text, titles, business names, webpages, react components, etc. this because the name Kuarxis turned to be the name of a person, therefore we rebranded it to Kuarxis which is not own by anyone as of 5/27/23.
3.- Renamed the database.js file to businessconfigurations.js, to better reflect the purpose of that file which is: contain the specific texts and busiess names and settings for the website which is generic and tailore it to the business specific case.

Version date: 5/14/23
Modificator name: Silverio Rodriguez Alcorta

ENHANCEMENTS:
1.- Added new logic to remove secrets from .env files and environment variables, to avoid exposing this secrets when commiting to github. Added secret values to AWS SSM Parameters Store using amplify function update, option update secrets, then added logic into the NodeJs App.js file to get secrets using SSM.getParameters. Also updated the environment variables to remove secrets into the Lambda function environment variables configurations.
2.- Removed the AWSConfig.js file since all process.env variables are now accessed directly and not thrugout AWSConfig.js.
