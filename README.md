Version date: 2/25/24
Modificator name: Silverio Rodriguez Alcorta
ENHANCEMENTS:
1.- Fixed defect: columns in surveyoutput screen showing in disorder, fixed it in surveyController superSurveyGetOutputValues function, added a sort action by the sequence fieldname into the await SurveySuperiorOutputLayout.find, this fixed the column order displayed in the screen. The weird thing here was that it was working before, but somehow this defect reappeared in DEV and also in QA environments of Oncare.

Git Dev Tag: tagkuarxisBeSurveySystemDEV-v1.0.0.5
Version date: 1/13/24
Modificator name: Silverio Rodriguez Alcorta
ENHANCEMENTS:
1.- Fixed defect: negative number showing up in the upload status in UploadSurveyAnswers when picking option NEW responses only. This fix was made in the Front End surveyActions.js in the slice calculations.
2.- Modularized the Survey Monkey calls into a MonkeyManager class, for better code reusability. Removed logic form the path surveys/surveymonkey/:id handler and transfered it to the MonkeyManager, the handler now calls MonkeyManager functions to execute logic and it only servers as a controller of the logic.
3.- Added a MonkeyWebhook for Completed Survey event with its corresponding handler function on the path surveys/surveymonkey/webhookcompletedeventTalentos2020. This path will be triggered by Survey Monkey whenever a new survey response is completed by a user, and it will also trigger the processing of the survey responses in the KSS system which will then store the responses into the corresponding output collection.
4.- Redesigned the update responses handler to integrate it with the MonkeyWebhook (mentioned above) so that when the webhook is triggered, the update responses function will process the survey accordingly.

Git Tag: tagkuarxisBeSurveySystemDEV-v1.0.0.4
Version date: 12/24/23
Modificator name: Silverio Rodriguez Alcorta
ENHANCEMENTS:
1.- Optimized the survey action to process Upload Answers by adding an option to only upload new answers, or reprocess the whole file again. This improved the upload time from 1.5 min to only 5 seconds for an average of 6 new answers on the files, instead of reprocessing all surveys which took the 1.5 min waiting time.
2.- Started integration with Survey Monkey to check which are the new answers added comparing versus the existent answers in the database.
3.- Started integratiion of the Create Survey Configs with Survey Monkey API to map the Survey System config to the survey monkey configs and later use it to get answers from Survey Monkey API automatically without uploading a file manually.

Git Tag: tagkuarxisBeSurveySystemQA-v1.0.0.3
Version date: 12/19/23
Modificator name: Silverio Rodriguez Alcorta
ENHANCEMENTS:
1.- Fixed issue when username is created with all UPPERCASE, but then users logs in with user in lowercase, the system was not finding that user and declined access. Fixed issue by making the user name search case-insensitive using RegEx with the i option when looking for username in mongoose User.FindOne.
2.- Fixed issue with the User Edit screen sometimes it tries to load the data when the User info is still undefined, added a additiona condition to the IF statement in the useEffect to check if User object is undefined, in which case it will dispatch the getUserDetails action, all this in the UserEditScreen.
3.- Returning a more friendly message when user and password does not match, saying "Email o password inv√°lidos."

Git Tag: kuarxisBeSurveySystem-v1.0.0.2
Version date: 12/18/23
Modificator name: Silverio Rodriguez Alcorta
ENHANCEMENTS:
1.- Fixed intermitemn disconnection issue. Root cause: the JWT_SECRET to validate token, sometimes was not populated in the process.env.JWT_SECRET variable, there seems to be a problem with it. I changed the logic to get the secret value directly from aws usig the SSM AWS module. Created new library awsMiscellaneous.js to include a function to return the secret value from AWS given the variable name.
